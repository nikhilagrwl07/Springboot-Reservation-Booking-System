# Few Notes

@SpringbootApplication - @Configuration + @ComponentScan + @EnableAutoConfiguration

    **@Configuration** - tags or mark a class as bean definition for application context
    **@ComponentScan** - tells Spring to look for other components, configurations and services in com.nikhil.RestaurantReservation
    **@EnableAutoConfiguration** - tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on class path settings, other beans, and various property settings. 

@RestController - @Controller + @ResponseBody
